## State Management

Global state is handled with React's built-in `useReducer` inside a `TaskContext` provider. No external state library is needed.

### Available actions

| Action | Description |
|---|---|
| `ADD_TASK` | Creates a new task with a generated ID |
| `UPDATE_TASK` | Updates any fields on an existing task |
| `DELETE_TASK` | Removes a task by ID |
| `MOVE_TASK` | Moves a task to a different column (status change) |
| `REORDER_TASK` | Reorders a task within the same column |

### Context helpers

| Helper | Description |
|---|---|
| `getTasksByStatus(status)` | Returns filtered tasks for a given column |
| `getUserById(id)` | Looks up a user object by ID |
| `isOverdue(deadline)` | Returns true if deadline is before today (timezone-safe) |

---

## Mock Data

The app ships with 5 mock users and 10 pre-loaded tasks spread across all three columns. Some tasks are intentionally set to past deadlines to demonstrate the overdue indicator.

**Mock users:** Arjun Mehta, Priya Sharma, Rahul Verma, Sneha Patil, Karan Desai

---

## Deployment (Vercel)

```bash
# 1. Push your project to a GitHub repository

# 2. Go to https://vercel.com and click "New Project"
